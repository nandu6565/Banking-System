Banking System Application
A simple banking application demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This application allows users to create accounts, check balances, deposit funds, and withdraw funds. Each operation is recorded as a transaction, and users can view their transaction history.

Features
Create Account: Users can create a new account.
Check Balance: Users can view their current balance.
Deposit Funds: Users can deposit money into their account.
Withdraw Funds: Users can withdraw money from their account, if they have sufficient balance.
Transaction History: Each deposit and withdrawal is recorded as a transaction, allowing users to view their transaction history.
OOP Concepts Used
Encapsulation: Each class (Bank, Account, Transaction) manages its data and behavior, exposing only necessary methods.
Abstraction: Simplified interactions between classes by focusing on high-level actions.
Modularity: Each class has a specific role, making the code modular and easy to maintain.
Reusability: Each class is designed to be reusable for future expansions or enhancements.
